            "projects/{project_id}/tenants/{tenant_id}/profiles/{profile_id}/applications/{application_id}".
            For example,
            "projects/foo/tenants/bar/profiles/baz/applications/qux".
        external_id (str):
            Required. Client side application identifier,
            used to uniquely identify the application.

            The maximum number of allowed characters is 255.

            The application date.
        stage (google.cloud.talent_v4beta1.types.Application.ApplicationStage):
            Required. What is the most recent stage of
            the application (that is, new, screen, send cv,
            hired, finished work)?  This field is
            intentionally not comprehensive of every
            possible status, but instead, represents
            statuses that would be used to indicate to the
            ML models good / bad matches.
        state (google.cloud.talent_v4beta1.types.Application.ApplicationState):
            The application state.
        interviews (Sequence[google.cloud.talent_v4beta1.types.Interview]):

        outcome_notes (str):
            Free text reason behind the recruitement
            outcome (for example, reason for withdraw /
            reject, reason for an unsuccessful finish, and
            so on).
            Number of characters allowed is 100.
        outcome (google.cloud.talent_v4beta1.types.Outcome):
            Outcome positiveness shows how positive the
            outcome is.
        is_match (google.protobuf.wrappers_pb2.BoolValue):
            Output only. Indicates whether this job
            application is a match to application related

            profile search response.
        job_title_snippet (str):
            Output only. Job title snippet shows how the
            job title is related to a search query. It's

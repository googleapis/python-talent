class JobQuery(proto.Message):
    r"""The query required to perform a search query.

    Attributes:
        query (str):
            The query string that matches against the job
            title, description, and location fields.

            The maximum number of allowed characters is 255.
        query_language_code (str):
            The language code of
            [query][google.cloud.talent.v4beta1.JobQuery.query]. For
            example, "en-US". This field helps to better interpret the
            query.

            If a value isn't specified, the query language code is
            automatically detected, which may not be accurate.

            Language code should be in BCP-47 format, such as "en-US" or
            "sr-Latn". For more information, see `Tags for Identifying
            Languages <https://tools.ietf.org/html/bcp47>`__.
        companies (Sequence[str]):
            This filter specifies the company entities to search
            against.

            If a value isn't specified, jobs are searched for against
            all companies.

            If multiple values are specified, jobs are searched against
            the companies specified.

            The format is
            "projects/{project_id}/tenants/{tenant_id}/companies/{company_id}".
            For example, "projects/foo/tenants/bar/companies/baz".

            If tenant id is unspecified, the default tenant is used. For
            example, "projects/foo/companies/bar".

            At most 20 company filters are allowed.
        location_filters (Sequence[google.cloud.talent_v4beta1.types.LocationFilter]):
            The location filter specifies geo-regions containing the
            jobs to search against. See
            [LocationFilter][google.cloud.talent.v4beta1.LocationFilter]
            for more information.

            If a location value isn't specified, jobs fitting the other
            search criteria are retrieved regardless of where they're
            located.

            If multiple values are specified, jobs are retrieved from
            any of the specified locations. If different values are
            specified for the
            [LocationFilter.distance_in_miles][google.cloud.talent.v4beta1.LocationFilter.distance_in_miles]
            parameter, the maximum provided distance is used for all
            locations.

            At most 5 location filters are allowed.
        job_categories (Sequence[google.cloud.talent_v4beta1.types.JobCategory]):
            The category filter specifies the categories of jobs to
            search against. See
            [JobCategory][google.cloud.talent.v4beta1.JobCategory] for
            more information.

            If a value isn't specified, jobs from any category are
            searched against.

            If multiple values are specified, jobs from any of the
            specified categories are searched against.
        commute_filter (google.cloud.talent_v4beta1.types.CommuteFilter):
            Allows filtering jobs by commute time with different travel
            methods (for example, driving or public transit).

            Note: This only works when you specify a
            [CommuteMethod][google.cloud.talent.v4beta1.CommuteMethod].
            In this case,
            [location_filters][google.cloud.talent.v4beta1.JobQuery.location_filters]
            is ignored.

            Currently we don't support sorting by commute time.
        company_display_names (Sequence[str]):
            This filter specifies the exact company
            [Company.display_name][google.cloud.talent.v4beta1.Company.display_name]
            of the jobs to search against.

            If a value isn't specified, jobs within the search results
            are associated with any company.

            If multiple values are specified, jobs within the search
            results may be associated with any of the specified
            companies.

            At most 20 company display name filters are allowed.
        compensation_filter (google.cloud.talent_v4beta1.types.CompensationFilter):
            This search filter is applied only to
            [Job.compensation_info][google.cloud.talent.v4beta1.Job.compensation_info].
            For example, if the filter is specified as "Hourly job with
            per-hour compensation > $15", only jobs meeting these
            criteria are searched. If a filter isn't defined, all open
            jobs are searched.
        custom_attribute_filter (str):
            This filter specifies a structured syntax to match against
            the
            [Job.custom_attributes][google.cloud.talent.v4beta1.Job.custom_attributes]
            marked as ``filterable``.

            The syntax for this expression is a subset of SQL syntax.

            Supported operators are: ``=``, ``!=``, ``<``, ``<=``,
            ``>``, and ``>=`` where the left of the operator is a custom
            field key and the right of the operator is a number or a
            quoted string. You must escape backslash (\) and quote (")
            characters.

            Supported functions are ``LOWER([field_name])`` to perform a
            case insensitive match and ``EMPTY([field_name])`` to filter
            on the existence of a key.

            Boolean expressions (AND/OR/NOT) are supported up to 3
            levels of nesting (for example, "((A AND B AND C) OR NOT D)
            AND E"), a maximum of 100 comparisons or functions are
            allowed in the expression. The expression must be < 6000
            bytes in length.

            Sample Query:
            ``(LOWER(driving_license)="class \"a\"" OR EMPTY(driving_license)) AND driving_years > 10``
        disable_spell_check (bool):
            This flag controls the spell-check feature.
            If false, the service attempts to correct a
            misspelled query, for example, "enginee" is
            corrected to "engineer".
            Defaults to false: a spell check is performed.
        employment_types (Sequence[google.cloud.talent_v4beta1.types.EmploymentType]):
            The employment type filter specifies the employment type of
            jobs to search against, such as
            [EmploymentType.FULL_TIME][google.cloud.talent.v4beta1.EmploymentType.FULL_TIME].

            If a value isn't specified, jobs in the search results
            includes any employment type.

            If multiple values are specified, jobs in the search results
            include any of the specified employment types.
        language_codes (Sequence[str]):
            This filter specifies the locale of jobs to search against,
            for example, "en-US".

            If a value isn't specified, the search results can contain
            jobs in any locale.

            Language codes should be in BCP-47 format, such as "en-US"
            or "sr-Latn". For more information, see `Tags for
            Identifying
            Languages <https://tools.ietf.org/html/bcp47>`__.

            At most 10 language code filters are allowed.
        publish_time_range (google.cloud.talent_v4beta1.types.TimestampRange):
            Jobs published within a range specified by
            this filter are searched against.
        excluded_jobs (Sequence[str]):
            This filter specifies a list of job names to
            be excluded during search.
            At most 400 excluded job names are allowed.

    Attributes:
        query (str):
            Keywords to match any text fields of
            profiles.
            For example, "software engineer in Palo Alto".
        location_filters (Sequence[google.cloud.talent_v4beta1.types.LocationFilter]):
            The location filter specifies geo-regions containing the
            profiles to search against.

            One of
            [LocationFilter.address][google.cloud.talent.v4beta1.LocationFilter.address]
            or
            [LocationFilter.lat_lng][google.cloud.talent.v4beta1.LocationFilter.lat_lng]
            must be provided or an error is thrown. If both
            [LocationFilter.address][google.cloud.talent.v4beta1.LocationFilter.address]
            and
            [LocationFilter.lat_lng][google.cloud.talent.v4beta1.LocationFilter.lat_lng]
            are provided, an error is thrown.

            The following logic is used to determine which locations in
            the profile to filter against:

            1. All of the profile's geocoded
               [Profile.addresses][google.cloud.talent.v4beta1.Profile.addresses]
               where
               [Address.usage][google.cloud.talent.v4beta1.Address.usage]
               is PERSONAL and
               [Address.current][google.cloud.talent.v4beta1.Address.current]
               is true.

            2. If the above set of locations is empty, all of the
               profile's geocoded
               [Profile.addresses][google.cloud.talent.v4beta1.Profile.addresses]
               where
               [Address.usage][google.cloud.talent.v4beta1.Address.usage]
               is CONTACT_INFO_USAGE_UNSPECIFIED and
               [Address.current][google.cloud.talent.v4beta1.Address.current]
               is true.

            3. If the above set of locations is empty, all of the
               profile's geocoded
               [Profile.addresses][google.cloud.talent.v4beta1.Profile.addresses]
               where
               [Address.usage][google.cloud.talent.v4beta1.Address.usage]
               is PERSONAL or CONTACT_INFO_USAGE_UNSPECIFIED and
               [Address.current][google.cloud.talent.v4beta1.Address.current]
               is not set.

            This means that any profiles without any
            [Profile.addresses][google.cloud.talent.v4beta1.Profile.addresses]
            that match any of the above criteria will not be included in
            a search with location filter. Furthermore, any
            [Profile.addresses][google.cloud.talent.v4beta1.Profile.addresses]
            where
            [Address.usage][google.cloud.talent.v4beta1.Address.usage]
            is WORK or SCHOOL or where
            [Address.current][google.cloud.talent.v4beta1.Address.current]
            is false are not considered for location filter.

            If a location filter isn't specified, profiles fitting the
            other search criteria are retrieved regardless of where
            they're located.

            If
            [LocationFilter.negated][google.cloud.talent.v4beta1.LocationFilter.negated]
            is specified, the result doesn't contain profiles from that
            location.

            If
            [LocationFilter.address][google.cloud.talent.v4beta1.LocationFilter.address]
            is provided, the
            [LocationType][google.cloud.talent.v4beta1.Location.LocationType],
            center point (latitude and longitude), and radius are
            automatically detected by the Google Maps Geocoding API and
            included as well. If
            [LocationFilter.address][google.cloud.talent.v4beta1.LocationFilter.address]
            cannot be geocoded, the filter falls back to keyword search.

            If the detected
            [LocationType][google.cloud.talent.v4beta1.Location.LocationType]
            is
            [LocationType.SUB_ADMINISTRATIVE_AREA][google.cloud.talent.v4beta1.Location.LocationType.SUB_ADMINISTRATIVE_AREA],
            [LocationType.ADMINISTRATIVE_AREA][google.cloud.talent.v4beta1.Location.LocationType.ADMINISTRATIVE_AREA],
            or
            [LocationType.COUNTRY][google.cloud.talent.v4beta1.Location.LocationType.COUNTRY],
            the filter is performed against the detected location name
            (using exact text matching). Otherwise, the filter is
            performed against the detected center point and a radius of
            detected location radius +
            [LocationFilter.distance_in_miles][google.cloud.talent.v4beta1.LocationFilter.distance_in_miles].

            If
            [LocationFilter.address][google.cloud.talent.v4beta1.LocationFilter.address]
            is provided,
            [LocationFilter.distance_in_miles][google.cloud.talent.v4beta1.LocationFilter.distance_in_miles]
            is the additional radius on top of the radius of the
            location geocoded from
            [LocationFilter.address][google.cloud.talent.v4beta1.LocationFilter.address].
            If
            [LocationFilter.lat_lng][google.cloud.talent.v4beta1.LocationFilter.lat_lng]
            is provided,
            [LocationFilter.distance_in_miles][google.cloud.talent.v4beta1.LocationFilter.distance_in_miles]
            is the only radius that is used.

            [LocationFilter.distance_in_miles][google.cloud.talent.v4beta1.LocationFilter.distance_in_miles]
            is 10 by default. Note that the value of
            [LocationFilter.distance_in_miles][google.cloud.talent.v4beta1.LocationFilter.distance_in_miles]
            is 0 if it is unset, so the server does not differentiate
            [LocationFilter.distance_in_miles][google.cloud.talent.v4beta1.LocationFilter.distance_in_miles]
            that is explicitly set to 0 and
            [LocationFilter.distance_in_miles][google.cloud.talent.v4beta1.LocationFilter.distance_in_miles]
            that is not set. Which means that if
            [LocationFilter.distance_in_miles][google.cloud.talent.v4beta1.LocationFilter.distance_in_miles]
            is explicitly set to 0, the server will use the default
            value of
            [LocationFilter.distance_in_miles][google.cloud.talent.v4beta1.LocationFilter.distance_in_miles]
            which is 10. To work around this and effectively set
            [LocationFilter.distance_in_miles][google.cloud.talent.v4beta1.LocationFilter.distance_in_miles]
            to 0, we recommend setting
            [LocationFilter.distance_in_miles][google.cloud.talent.v4beta1.LocationFilter.distance_in_miles]
            to a very small decimal number (such as 0.00001).

            If
            [LocationFilter.distance_in_miles][google.cloud.talent.v4beta1.LocationFilter.distance_in_miles]
            is negative, an error is thrown.
        job_title_filters (Sequence[google.cloud.talent_v4beta1.types.JobTitleFilter]):
            Job title filter specifies job titles of profiles to match
            on.

            If a job title isn't specified, profiles with any titles are
            retrieved.

            If multiple values are specified, profiles are retrieved
            with any of the specified job titles.

            If
            [JobTitleFilter.negated][google.cloud.talent.v4beta1.JobTitleFilter.negated]
            is specified, the result won't contain profiles with the job
            titles.

            For example, search for profiles with a job title "Product
            Manager".
        employer_filters (Sequence[google.cloud.talent_v4beta1.types.EmployerFilter]):
            Employer filter specifies employers of profiles to match on.

            If an employer filter isn't specified, profiles with any
            employers are retrieved.

            If multiple employer filters are specified, profiles with
            any matching employers are retrieved.

            If
            [EmployerFilter.negated][google.cloud.talent.v4beta1.EmployerFilter.negated]
            is specified, the result won't contain profiles that match
            the employers.

            For example, search for profiles that have working
            experience at "Google LLC".
        education_filters (Sequence[google.cloud.talent_v4beta1.types.EducationFilter]):
            Education filter specifies education of profiles to match
            on.

            If an education filter isn't specified, profiles with any
            education are retrieved.

            If multiple education filters are specified, profiles that
            match any education filters are retrieved.

            If
            [EducationFilter.negated][google.cloud.talent.v4beta1.EducationFilter.negated]

            the
            [Profile.custom_attributes][google.cloud.talent.v4beta1.Profile.custom_attributes]
            that are marked as ``filterable``.

            The syntax for this expression is a subset of Google SQL
            syntax.

            String custom attributes: supported operators are =, !=
            where the left of the operator is a custom field key and the
            right of the operator is a string (surrounded by quotes)
            value.

            Numeric custom attributes: Supported operators are '>', '<'
            or '=' operators where the left of the operator is a custom
            field key and the right of the operator is a numeric value.

            Supported functions are LOWER(<field_name>) to perform case
            insensitive match and EMPTY(<field_name>) to filter on the
            existence of a key.

            Boolean expressions (AND/OR/NOT) are supported up to 3
            levels of nesting (for example "((A AND B AND C) OR NOT D)
            AND E"), and there can be a maximum of 50
            comparisons/functions in the expression. The expression must
            be < 2000 characters in length.

            Sample Query: (key1 = "TEST" OR LOWER(key1)="test" OR NOT
            EMPTY(key1))

            for the details of this signal.

            The candidate availability filter helps a recruiter
            understand if a specific candidate is likely to be actively
            seeking new job opportunities based on an aggregated set of
            signals. Specifically, the intent is NOT to indicate the
            candidate's potential qualification / interest / close
            ability for a specific job.
        availability_filters (Sequence[google.cloud.talent_v4beta1.types.AvailabilityFilter]):
            The availability filter which filters based on

            The availability filter helps a recruiter understand if a
            specific candidate is likely to be actively seeking new job
            opportunities based on an aggregated set of signals.
            Specifically, the intent is NOT to indicate the candidate's
            potential qualification / interest / close ability for a
            specific job.
